SQL

"Structured Query Language"

When constructing a table in SQL, it's very important to choose
one column to be your primary key.

Primary keys enable rows of a table to be uniquely and quickly identified
Choosing the primary key appropiately can make subsequent
operations on the tagle much easier

It is also possbile to establish a joint primary key:
A combination of two columns that is always guaranteed to be unique

We will primarily consider just four operations that one may perform
o an table:

INSERT
SELECT
UPDATE
DELETE

INSERT
    Add information to a table.
    
        INSERT INTO
        <table>
        (<columns>)
        VALUES
        (<values>)

    example:

       INSERT INTO
       users
       (username, password, fullname)
       VALUES
       ('newman', 'USMAIL', 'Newman')

    example 2:
       INSERT INTO
       moms
       (username, mother)
       VALUES
       ('kramer', 'Babs Kramer')


SELECT
    Extract information from a table.

        SELECT
        <columns>
        FROM
        <table>
        WHERE
        <condition>
        ORDER BY
        <column>
        
    example:
        
        SELECT
        idnum, fullname
        FROM
        users

    example 2:

        SELECT
        password
        FROM
        users
        WHERE
        idnum < 12
        
    example 3:

        SELECT
        *       // *: every column
        FROM
        mom
        WHERE
        username = 'jerry'

What if we now find ourselves in a situation where we need to get a user's fullname (from "users" table) and their mother's name (from the mother table).

SELECT (JOIN)
    Extract information from multiple tables.

        SELECT
        <columns>
        FROM
        <table1>
        JOIN
        <table2>
        ON
        <predicate>

    example:
        
        SELECT
        users.fullname, moms.mother
        FROM
        users
        JOIN
        moms
        ON
        users.username = moms.username


UPDATE
    Modify information in a table.

        UPDATE
        <table>
        SET
        <coumn> = <value>
        WHERE
        <predicate>

    example:
        
        UPDATE
        users
        SET
        password = 'yadayada'
        WHERE
        idnum = 10


DELETE
    Remove information from a table
        
        DELETE FROM
        <table>
        WHERE
        <predicate>

    example:

        DELETE FROM
        users
        WHERE
        username = 'newman'


C: "Create"
R: "Read"
U: "Update"
D: "Delete"

CREATE, INSERT
SELECT
UPDATE
DELETE
...

sqlite3

.mode csv, tsv ...
.import 'filename.csv' table_name
CREATE TABLE table_name (column type, ...);
.schema
SELECT columns(* for all columns) FROM table_name;

AVG
COUNT DISTINCT
LOWER
MAX
MIN
UPPER...

SELECT DISTINCT(column) FROM SHOWS

WHERE
LIKE
ORDER BY
LIMIT
GROUP BY
...

SELECT title FROM shows WHERE tilte = "the office";
